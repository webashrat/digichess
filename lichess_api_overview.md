Rate limiting
All requests are rate limited using various strategies, to ensure the API remains responsive for everyone. Only make one request at a time. If you receive an HTTP response with a 429 status, please wait a full minute before resuming API usage.

Streaming with ND-JSON
Some API endpoints stream their responses as Newline Delimited JSON a.k.a. nd-json, with one JSON object per line.

Here's a JavaScript utility function to help reading NDJSON streamed responses.

Authentication
Which authentication method is right for me?
Read about the Lichess API authentication methods and code examples

Personal Access Token
Personal API access tokens allow you to quickly interact with Lichess API without going through an OAuth flow.

Generate a personal access token
curl https://lichess.org/api/account -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
NodeJS example
Token Security
Keep your tokens secret. Do not share them in public repositories or public forums.
Your tokens can be used to make your account perform arbitrary actions (within the limits of the tokens' scope). You remain responsible for all activities on your account.
Do not hardcode tokens in your application's code. Use environment variables or a secure storage and ensure they are not shipped/exposed to users. Be especially careful that they are not included in frontend bundles or apps that are shipped to users.
If you suspect a token has been compromised, revoke it immediately.
To see your active tokens or revoke them, see your Personal API access tokens.

Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
The authorization code flow with PKCE allows your users to login with Lichess. Lichess supports unregistered and public clients (no client authentication, choose any unique client id). The only accepted code challenge method is S256. Access tokens are long-lived (expect one year), unless they are revoked. Refresh tokens are not supported.

See the documentation for the OAuth endpoints or the PKCE RFC for a precise protocol description.

Token format
Access tokens and authorization codes match ^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$. The length of tokens can be increased without notice. Make sure your application can handle at least 512 characters. By convention tokens have a recognizable prefix, but do not rely on this.

Stream moves of a game​Copy link
Stream positions and moves of any ongoing game, in ndjson. A description of the game is sent as a first message. Then a message is sent each time a move is played. Finally, a description of the game is sent when it finishes, and the stream is closed. Ongoing games are delayed by a few seconds ranging from 3 to 60 depending on the time control, as to prevent cheat bots from using this API. No more than 8 game streams can be opened at the same time from the same IP address.

GameStartEvent
Create a seek​Copy link
Create a public seek, to start a game with a random player.

Real-time seek
Specify the time and increment clock values. The response is streamed but doesn't contain any information.

Keep the connection open to keep the seek active.

If the client closes the connection, the seek is canceled. This way, if the client terminates, the user won't be paired in a game they wouldn't play. When the seek is accepted, or expires, the server closes the connection.

Make sure to also have an Event stream open, to be notified when a game starts. We recommend opening the Event stream first, then the seek stream. This way, you won't miss the game event if the seek is accepted immediately.

Correspondence seek
Specify the days per turn value. The response is not streamed, it immediately completes with the seek ID. The seek remains active on the server until it is joined by someone.

Body
application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Stream Board game state​Copy link

The list of bulk pairing the logged in user created.

Create a bulk pairing​Copy link
Schedule many games at once, up to 24h in advance. OAuth tokens are required for all paired players, with the challenge:write scope. You can schedule up to 500 games every 10 minutes. Contact us if you need higher limits. If games have a real-time clock, each player must have only one pairing. For correspondence games, players can have multiple pairings within the same bulk.

The entire bulk is rejected if:

a token is missing
a token is present more than once (except in correspondence)
a token lacks the challenge:write scope
a player account is closed
a player is paired more than once (except in correspondence)
a bulk is already scheduled to start at the same time with the same player
you have 20 scheduled bulks
you have 1000 scheduled games
Partial bulks are never created. Either it all fails, or it all succeeds. When it fails, it does so with an error message explaining the issue. Failed bulks are not counted in the rate limiting, they are free. Fix the issues, manually or programmatically, then retry to schedule the bulk. A successful bulk creation returns a JSON bulk document. Its ID can be used for further operations.

Manually start clocks​Copy link
Immediately start all clocks of the games of a bulk pairing. This overrides the startClocksAt value of an existing bulk pairing. If the games have not yet been created (bulk.pairAt is in the future), then this does nothing. If the clocks have already started (bulk.startClocksAt is in the past), then this does nothing.

Stream an ongoing broadcast round as PGN​Copy link
This streaming endpoint first sends all games of a broadcast round in PGN format. Then, it waits for new moves to be played. As soon as it happens, the entire PGN of the game is sent to the stream. The stream will also send PGNs when games are added to the round. This is the best way to get updates about an ongoing round. Streaming means no polling, and no pollings means no latency, and minimum impact on the server.

cursed-win and blessed-loss means the 50-move rule prevents the decisive result.

syzygy-win and syzygy-loss means exact result is unknown due to DTZ rounding, i.e., the win or loss could also be prevented by the 50-move rule if the user has deviated from the tablebase recommendation since the last pawn move or capture.

maybe-win and maybe-loss means the result with regard to the 50-move rule is unknown, because DTZ is unknown and the DTC tablebase does not guarantee to reach a zeroing move as soon as possible.

cursed-win and blessed-loss means the 50-move rule prevents the decisive result.

syzygy-win and syzygy-loss means exact result is unknown due to DTZ rounding, i.e., the win or loss could also be prevented by the 50-move rule if the user has deviated from the tablebase recommendation since the last pawn move or capture.

maybe-win and maybe-loss means the result with regard to the 50-move rule is unknown, because DTZ is unknown and the DTC tablebase does not guarantee to reach a zeroing move as soon as possible.

cursed-win and blessed-loss means the 50-move rule prevents the decisive result.

syzygy-win and syzygy-loss means exact result is unknown due to DTZ rounding, i.e., the win or loss could also be prevented by the 50-move rule if the user has deviated from the tablebase recommendation since the last pawn move or capture.

maybe-win and maybe-loss means the result with regard to the 50-move rule is unknown, because DTZ is unknown and the DTC tablebase does not guarantee to reach a zeroing move as soon as possible.

Request authorization code​Copy link
OAuth2 authorization endpoint. Start the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE by securely generating two random strings unique to each authorization request:

code_verifier
state
Store these in session storage. Make sure not to reveal code_verifier to eavesdroppers. Do not show it in URLs, do not abuse state to store it, do not send it over insecure connections. However it is fine if the user themselves can extract code_verifier, which will always be possible for fully client-side apps. Then send the user to this endpoint. They will be prompted to grant authorization and then be redirected back to the given redirect_uri. If the authorization failed, the following query string parameters will be appended to the redirection:

error, in particular with value access_denied if the user cancelled authorization
error_description to aid debugging
state, exactly as passed in the state parameter
If the authorization succeeded, the following query string parameters will be appended to the redirection:

code, containing a fresh short-lived authorization code
state, exactly as passed in the state parameter
Next, to defend against cross site request forgery, check that the returned state matches the state you originally generated.

Finally, continue by using the authorization code to obtain an access token.

Query Parameters

Must be code.

client_idCopy link to client_id
